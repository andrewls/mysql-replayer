# This script is designed to allow you to replay a MySQL log file against a
# new mysql URL. It was designed to have three distinct stages of operation
#
# 1 - The "Pre-Test" time. Queries in the logs from during this window will only
#     be run if they are insert, update, or delete queries. The only purpose of
#     this mode is to be able to keep the DB up to date so that it's accurate
# 2 - The "Actual Test" window time, in which this script _exactly_ replays the
#     same queries (including SELECTs) that were originally run in the logs.
# 3 - The "Post Test" time, in which all queries are skipped, because honestly
#     we don't care what happened at this point.
#
# The test uses the MySQL protocol to communicate, so it can access any database
# that is capable of communicating over the MySQL protocol. It is therefore
# able to communicate with any database that speaks MySQL, including Amazon's
# Aurora DB.
